once a player connects to the MC server, they are messaged a one-time-pass (OTP). This OTP is a 5-character long, lowercase, alpha-numeric string, excluding the characters 'l' and 'o' ('l', because it may resemble '1' and 'o' because it can be homophonous with '0').

the player sends this OTP to the voice server.

OTPs expire after 3 minutes or when their associated player quits the server, whichever comes first.

if an OTP expires while its associated player is still on the server, the server messages and associates to that player a new OTP.

the voice server, if it receives a valid (and therefore unexpired) OTP, will associate the client sending the OTP with the player who received it. the voice server knows player-to-OTP associations because it runs on the same process as the MC server plugin.


server says "we're resetting your token, here's your new one" to everyone every maybe 10 minutes. If a client doesn't respond with some acknowledgement, the server sends it again. server message should probably come with something that uniquely identifies each reset, so that if a client's acknowledgement doesn't reach and the server sends the message to them again, the client knows that it is the same reset.
